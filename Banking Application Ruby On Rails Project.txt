Banking Application Ruby On Rails Project

1.At first create the project by run this command in Command prompt with ruby on rails:
=>cd C:\Users\user\RubymineProjects
=>rails new bankapp
=>cd bankapp


Now Creating a Rails model:
rails generate model ModelName attribute:type
model names are singular.

=>rails g model Client first_name:string last_name:string middle_name:string client_number:string
=>rake db:migrate


Again Creating a Rails model:
=>rails g model BankAccount client:references balance:decimal account_number:string
=>rake db:migrate


Again Creating a Rails model:
=>rails g model AccountTransaction amount:decimal transaction_type:string bank_account:references
=>rake db:migrate



2.Now added this code in "GEMFILE":
https://rubygems.org/gems/bootstrap-sass/versions/3.3.7
gem 'bootstrap-sass', '~> 3.3', '>= 3.3.7'

We Don't Use this gem file so remove the turbolinks From views>layouts.application.html.erb:
gem 'turbolinks', '~> 5'


https://rubygems.org/gems/haml/versions/5.0.4
gem 'haml', '~> 5.0', '>= 5.0.4'


Now run this command in cmd:
=>bundle



Added this code in models>client.rb:
[client must be give his name and the client_number must be unique.Also before saving database the change the name in uppercase]
class Client < ApplicationRecord
	validates :first_name, presence: true
	validates :last_name, presence: true
	validates :middle_name, presence: true
	validates :client_number, presence: true, uniqueness: true

	before_save :format_name

	def format_name
		self.first_name  = self.first_name.upcase
		self.last_name   = self.last_name.upcase
		self.middle_name = self.middle_name.upcase
	end

	def to_s
		"#{last_name}, #{first_name} #{middle_name}"
	end 

end




Added this code in models>bank_ccount.rb:


class BankAccount < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :client

  validates :client, presence: true
  validates :account_number, presence: true, uniqueness: true
  validates :balance, presence: true, numericality: true

  before_validation :load_defaults

  def load_defaults
  	if self.new_record?
  		self.balance = 0.00
  end

  def to_s
  	account_number
  end
end



Also Add This line in models>client.rb:
[client can have many bank account]

	has_many :bank_accounts

	
	
	
	
	
Added this code in models>account_transaction.rb:

class AccountTransaction < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :bank_account

  TRANSACTION_TYPES = ["withdraw", "deposit"]

  validates :bank_account, presence: true
  validates :amount, presence:true, numericality: true
  validates :transaction_type, presence: true, inclusion: { in: TRANSACTION_TYPES}
end



We forgot to added the transaction_number in account_transactions table when created model:   
t.string "transaction_number"
For this reason,
create a migration file run this line in command prompt:
=>rails g migration add_transaction_number_to_account_transactions transaction_number:string
=>rake db:migrate



After added transaction_number in account_transactions table now added this code in account_transactions.rb:

validates :transaction_number, presence: true, uniqueness: true

  before_validation :load_defaults

  def load_defaults
  	#if a transaction occured assigned a transaction number...
  	if self.new_record?
  		self.transaction_number = SecureRandom.uuid
  end






3.Remove from app>assets>javascripts>application.js:
//= require turbolinks
//= require_tree .

and also added this line:
//= require bootstrap



and also change the name from app>assets>stylesheets>application.css to application.scss and added this code:

@import "bootstrap-sprockets";
@import "bootstrap";


Now check:
=>rails s

http://localhost:3000/    successfully runned....


Now set the routes in config>routes.rb:
root to: "pages#index" 


Now Creating a Rails controller:
rails generate controller ControllerName.
controller names is plural.
=>rails g controller pages



added this code in controllers>pages_controller.rb:
def index
end


also added this "index.html.haml" file in views>pages and added this code:
%h1
	My Bank

	
http://localhost:3000/    successfully runned....




4.write code in views>layouts>application.html.erb:
<div class="container">
  <%= yield %>
</div>


and also added code in pages>index.html.haml:
.row
	.col-md-12
	%h2
	  number of Accounts: #{number_of_accounts}
	%h2
	  number of Clients: #{number_of_clients}
	  
	  
	    
We added this two  local variable or method name [number_of_accounts and number_of_clients] in pages>index.html.haml but not create any method in helpers>application_helper.rb. So when we run http://localhost:3000/  this error occur: 
"  NameError in Pages#index
Showing C:/Users/user/RubymineProjects/bankapp/app/views/pages/index.html.haml where line #7 raised:

undefined local variable or method `number_of' for #<#<Class:0x419d528>:0xae80568>
Did you mean?  number_field   "



Now added this method in helpers>application_helper.rb:

module ApplicationHelper
	def number_of_accounts
		BankAccount.count
	end

	def number_of_clients
		Client.count
	end
end

http://localhost:3000/    successfully runned....
